            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But and if the diuerſitie of opinions in the vulgar ſort for placyng of their felicitie ſhall be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo, the varietie ſhall be found ſo great, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſo diſſonant, yea plainly monſterouſe, that no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt witte would voucheſafe to loſe time in hearyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or rather (as I may ſaie) no witte is of ſo exact remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that can conſider together the monſterouſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them all. And yet not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng this repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diuerſitie, in two thynges do they all agree.

And therfore do all men put their whole ſtudie to gette that thyng, wherein they haue perſwaded them ſelf that feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,
<pb facs="tcp:16117:4"/>doth conſiſt. Wherfore ſome whiche put their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in fedyng their bellies, thinke no pain to be hard, nor no dede to be vnhoneſt, that may be a meanes to fill that foule pauche.

If I ſhould particularly ouerru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne but the common ſortes of men, which put their felicitie in their deſires, it wold make a great boke of it ſelf. Therfore wyl I let them al go, and conclude as I began, That all men employ their whole endeuour to that thing, wherin thei thinke felicitie to ſtand. whiche thyng who ſo liſteth to mark exactly, ſhall be able to eſpie and iudge the natures of al men, whoſe conuerſacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth know, though thei vſe great diſſimulacion to colour their deſires, eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they perceiue other men to miſlyke that which thei ſo much deſire: For no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold gladly haue his appetite improued. And herof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth that ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nde. thing wherin al agree, that euery man would moſt gladly win all other men to his ſect, and to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his opinion, and as far as he dare, will diſpraiſe all other mens iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and praiſe his own waies only, onles it be when he diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muleth, and that for the furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his own purpoſe. And this propertie alſo doth geue great light to the full knowledge of mens natures, which as all men ought to obſerue, ſo princes aboue other haue moſt cauſe to mark for ſundrie occaſions which may lye them on, wherof I ſhall not nede to ſpeke any farther, conſideryng not only the greatnes of wit, and exactnes of iudgement whiche god hath lent vnto your highnes perſon, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt graue wiſdom and profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d knowledge of your maieſties moſt honorable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your highnes may ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all thinges conuenient, that leſſe ſhal it nede to vnderſtand by priuate readyng, but yet not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to refuſe to read as often as occaſion may ſerue, for bokes dare ſpeake, when men feare to diſpleaſe. But to
<pb facs="tcp:16117:4"/>returne agayne to my firſte matter, if none other good thing maie be lerned at their maners, which ſo wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place their felicity, in ſo miſerable a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (that while they thinke them ſelfes happy, their felicitie muſt nedes ſeme vnluckie, to be by them ſo euill placed) yet this may men learn at them, by thoſe .ij. ſpectacles to eſpye the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete natures and diſpoſitions of others, whiche thyng vnto a wiſe man is muche auailable. And thus will I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this great tablement of vnhappie hap, and wil come to .iij. other ſortes of a better degre, wherof the one put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth felicitie to conſiſt in power and royaltie.

                  <p>By whyche lettre it appeareth that hee eſtemed lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge and knowledge aboue power of men.

Whereby apeareth, how he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med learning, and what felicity he putte therin, reputing al the worlde ſaue him ſelfe to be inferiour to Diogenes. And bi al coniecturs, Alexander did eſteme Diogenes one of them whiche contemned the vaine eſtimation of the diſceitfull world, and put his whole felicity in knowledg of vertue, and practiſe of the ſame, though ſome reporte
<pb facs="tcp:16117:6"/>that he knew more vertue then he folowed: But whatſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer he was, it appeareth that Socrates and Plato and many other did forſake their liuings and ſel away their patrimony, to the intent to ſeeke and trauaile for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which examples I ſhall not need to repete to your Maieſty, partly for that your highnes doth often reade them and other lyke, and partly ſith your maieſty hath at hand ſuch learned ſchoolemayſters, which can much better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I, declare them vnto your highnes, and that more largely alſo then the ſhortenes of thys epiſtle will permit.

If I bee able to doo you much good, then be you not your owne friendes, but greatlye your owne enemies to make ſo little of me, which maye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite you ſo muche. For if I were as vncurteous as you vnkind, I ſhuld vtterly refuſe to do them any good, which will ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly put me to the trial and profe of my commodities, or els to ſuffre exile, and namely ſithe I ſhal only yeld benefites to other, and receaue none againe. But and if you could ſaye truely, that my benefites be nother many nor yet greate, yet if they bee anye, I doo yelde more to you, then I doo receaue againe of you, and therefore I oughte not to bee repelled of them that loue them ſelfe, althoughe they loue me not at all for my ſelfe. But as I am in nature a liberall ſcience, ſo canne I not againſte nature contende with your inhumanitye, but muſte ſhewe my ſelfe liberall euen to myne enemies. Yet this is my comforte againe, that I haue none enemies but them that knowe me not, and therefore may hurte themſelues, but can not noye me. Yf they diſpraiſe the thinge that they know not, all wiſe men will blame them and not credite them. and yf they thinke they knowe me, lette theym ſhewe one vntruthe and erroure in me, and I wyll geue the victorye.</p>

                  <p>Yet can no humayne ſcience ſaie thus, but I onely, that there is no ſparke of vntruthe in me: but all my doctrine and workes are without any blemiſhe of errour that mans reaſon can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. And nexte vnto me in certaintie are my three ſyſters, Arithmetike, Muſike, and Aſtronomie, whiche are alſo ſo nere knitte in amitee, that he that loueth the one, can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the other, and in eſpeciall Geometrie, of whiche not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe thre, but all other artes do borow great ayde, as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereafter ſhall be ſhewed. But firſt will I beginne with the vnlearned ſorte, that you maie perceiue how that no arte can ſtand without me. For if I ſhould declare how many wayes my helpe is vſed, in meaſuryng of ground, for medow, corne, and wodde: in hedgyng, in dichyng, and in ſtackes makyng, I thinke the poore Huſband man would be more thankefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, then he is nowe, whyſes he thinketh that he hath ſmall benefite by me. Yet this maie he coniecture certainly, that if he kepe not the rules of Geometrie, he can not meaſure any ground truely. And in dichyng, if he kepe not a proportion of bredth in the mouthe, to the bredthe of the bottome, and iuſte ſlopeneſſe in the ſides agreable to them bothe, the diche ſhall be faultie many waies. When he doth make ſtackes for corne, or for heye, he practiſeth good Geometrie, els would thei not long ſtand: So that in ſome ſtackes, whiche ſtand on foure pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and yet made round, doe increaſe greatter and greatter a good height, and then againe turne ſmaller and ſmaller vnto the toppe: you maie ſee ſo good Geometrie, that it were very difficult to counterfaite the lyke in any kynde of buildyng. As for other infinite waies that he vſeth my benefite, I ouerpaſſe for ſhortneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Carpenters, Karuers, Joyners, and Maſons, doe willingly acknowledge that they can worke nothyng without reaſon of Geometrie, in ſo muche that they chalenge me as a peculiare ſcience for them. But in that they ſhould do wrong to all other men, ſeyng euerie kynde of men haue ſom benefit by me, not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in buildyng, whiche is but other mennes coſtes, and the arte of Carpenters, Maſons, and the other aforeſayd, but in their

                  <p>But now to procede with learned profeſsions, in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike and Rhetorike and all partes of phyloſophy, there nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth none other proofe then Ariſtotle his teſtimony, whiche without Geometry proueth almoſt nothinge. In Logike all his good ſyllogiſmes and demonſtrations, hee declareth by the principles of Geometrye. In philoſophye, nether motion, nor time, nor ayrye impreſsions coulde hee aptely declare, but by the helpe of Geometrye as his woorkes do witnes. Yea the faculties of the minde do the hee expreſse by ſimilitude to ſigures of Geometrye. And in morall phyloſophy he thought that iuſtice coulde not wel be taught, nor yet well executed without proportion geometricall. And this eſtimacion of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry he maye ſeeme to haue learned of his maiſter Plato, which withoute Geometrye wolde teache nothinge, nother wold admitte any to heare him, except he were experte in Geometry. And what merualle if he ſo muche eſtemed geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye, ſeinge his opinion was, that Godde was alwaaies wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
<pb facs="tcp:16117:10"/>kinge by Geometrie? Whiche ſentence Plutarche declareth at large. And although Plat o do vſe the helpe of Geometrye in all the moſt waighte matter of a common wealth, yet it is ſo generall in vſe, that no ſmall thinges almoſt can be wel done without it. And therfore ſaith he: that Geometrye is to be lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, if it were for none other cauſe, but that all other artes are bothe ſoner and more ſurely vnderſtand by helpe of it.</p>
                  <p>What greate help it dothe in phyſike, Galene doth ſo often and ſo copiouſely declare, that no man whiche hath redde any booke almoſte of his, can be ignorant thereof. in ſo much that he coulde neuer cure well a rounde vlcere, tyll reaſon geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall dydde teache it hym. Hippocrates is earneſt in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyſhynge that ſtudy of geometrie muſt prepare the way to phyſike, as well as to all other artes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhoulde ſeeme ſomewhat to tedious, if I ſhoulde recken vp, howe the diuines alſo in all their myſteries of ſcripture doo vſe healpe of geometrie: and alſo that lawyers can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnderſtande the hole lawe, no nor yet the firſte title ther of exactly without Geometrie. For if lawes can not well be eſtabliſhed, nor iuſtice duelie executed without geometricall proportion, as bothe Plato in his Politike bokes, and Ariſtotle in his Moralles doo largely declare. Yea ſithe Lycurgus that cheefe lawmaker amongeſt the Lacedemonians, is moſte praiſed for that he didde chaunge the ſtate of their common wealthe frome the proportion Arithmeticall to a proportion geometricall, whiche without knowledg of bothe he coulde not dooe, than is it eaſye to perceaue howe neceſsarie Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie is for the lawe and ſtudentes thereof. And if I ſhall ſaie preciſelie and freelie as I thinke, he is vtterlie deſtitute of all abilitee to iudge in anie arte, that is not ſommewhat experte in the Theoremes of Geometrie.</p>
                  <p>And that cauſed Galene to ſay of hym ſelfe, that he coulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perceaue what a demonſtration was, no not ſo muche, as whether there were any or none, tyll he had by geometrie gotten abilitee to vnderſtande it, although he heard the beſte teachers that were in his tyme. It ſhuld be to longe and nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:16117:11"/>alſo to declare what helpe all other artes Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call haue by geometrie, ſith it is the grounde of all theyr cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie, and no man ſtudious in them is ſo doubtful therof, that he ſhall nede any perſuaſion to procure credite thereto. For he can not reade .ij. lines almoſte in any mathematicall ſcience, but he ſhall eſpie the nedefulnes of geometrie. But to auoyde tediouſneſſe I will make an ende hereof with that famous ſentence of auncient Pythagoras, That who ſo will trauayle by learnyng to attayne wyfedome, ſhall, neuer approche to any excellencie without the artes mathematicall, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Arithmetike and Geometrie.</p>
                  <p>And yf I ſhall ſomewhat ſpeake of noble men, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of realmes, howe needefull Geometrye maye bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, then muſt I repete all that I haue ſayde before, ſithe in them ought all knowledge to abounde, namely that maye appertaine either to good gouernaunce in time of peace, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wittye pollicies in time of warre. For miniſtration of good lawes in time of peace Lycurgus example with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies of Plato and Ariſtotle may ſuffiſe. And as for war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, I might thinke it ſufficient that Vegetius hath written, and after him Valturius in commendation of Geometry, for vſe of warres, but all their woordes ſeeme to ſaye nothinge, in compariſon to the example of Archimedes worthy woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes made by geometrie, for the defence of his countrey, to reade the wonderfull praiſe of his wittie deuiſes, ſet foorthe by the moſte famous hyſtories of Liuius, Plutarche, and Plinie, and all other hyſtoriographiers, whyche wryte of the ſtronge ſiege of <hi>Syracuſae</hi> made by that vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant capitayne, and noble warriour <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer was ſo great, that all men meruayled how that one ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee coulde withſtande his wonderfull force ſo longe. But much more woulde they meruaile, if they vnderſtode that one man onely dyd withſtand all Marcellus ſtrength, and with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter engines deſtroied his engines to the vtter aſtonyſhment of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and all that were with hym. He had inuented ſuche balaſtelas that dyd ſhoote out a hundred dartes at one
<pb facs="tcp:16117:11"/>ſhotte, to the great deſtruction of <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſouldiours, wherby a fonde tale was ſpredde abrode, how that in Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae there was a wonderfull gyant, whiche had a hundred han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and coulde ſhoote a hundred dartes at ones. And as this fable was ſpredde of Archimedes, ſo many other haue been fayned to bee gyantes and monſters, bycauſe they dyd ſuche thynges, whiche farre paſſed the witte of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So dyd they feyne Argus to haue a hundred eies, bicauſe they herde of his wonderfull circumſpection, and thoughte that as it was aboue their capacitee, ſo it could not be, onleſſe he had a hundred eies. So imagined they Janus to haue two faces, one lokyng forwarde, and an other backwarde, bycauſe he coulde ſo wittily compare thynges paſte with thynges that were to come, and ſo duely pondre them, as yf they were all preſent. Of like reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did they feyn Lynceus to haue ſuch ſharp ſyght, that he coulde ſee through walles and hylles, bycauſe peraduenture he dyd by naturall iudgement declare what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditees myght be digged out of the grounde. And an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite noumbre lyke fables are there, whiche ſprange all of lyke reaſon.</p>
                  <p>For what other thyng meaneth the fable of the great gyant Atlas, whiche was ymagined to beare vp heauen on his ſhul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? but that he was a man of ſo high a witte, that it reached vnto the ſkye, and was ſo ſkylfull in Aſtronomie, and coulde tell before hande of Eclipſes, and other like thynges as truely as though he dyd rule the ſterres, and gouerne the planettes.</p>
                  <p>So was Eolus accompted god of the wyndes, and to haue theim all in a caue at his pleaſure, by reaſon that he was a wit tie man in naturall knowlege, and obſerued well the change of wethers, and was the fyrſt that taught the obſeruation of the wyndes. And lyke reſon is to be geuen of al the old fables.</p>
                  <p>But to retourne agayne to Archimedes, he dyd alſo by arte perſpectiue (whiche is a parte of geometrie) deuiſe ſuch glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes within the towne of Syracuſae, that dyd bourne their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſhyppes a great way from the to wne, whyche was a meruaylous politike thynge. And if I ſhulde repete the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietees
<pb facs="tcp:16117:12"/>of ſuche ſtraunge inuentions, as Archimedes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue wrought by geometrie, I ſhould not onely excede the order of a preface, but I ſhould alſo ſpeake of ſuche thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges as can not well be vnderſtande in talke, without ſomme knowledge in the principles of geometrie.</p>
                  <p>But this will I promyſe, that if I may perceaue my pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be thankfully taken, I wyll not onely write of ſuche pleaſant inuentions, declaryng what they were, but alſo wil teache howe a great numbre of them were wroughte, that they may be practiſed in this tyme alſo. Wherby ſhall be plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly perceaued, that many thynges ſeme impoſsible to be done, whiche by arte may very well be wrought. And whan they be wrought, and the reaſon therof not vnderſtande, than ſay the vulgare people, that thoſe thynges are done by negroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And hereof came it that fryer Bakon was accompted ſo greate a negromancier, whiche neuer vſed that arte (by any coniecture that I can fynde) but was in geometrie and other mathematicall ſciences ſo experte, that he coulde dooe by theim ſuche thynges as were wonderfull in the ſyght of most people.</p>
                  <p>Great talke there is of a glaſſe that he made in Oxforde, in whiche men myght ſee thynges that were doon in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that was iudged to be done by power of euyll ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. But I knowe the reaſon of it to bee good and naturall, and to be wrought by geometrie (ſythe perſpectiue is a parte of it) and to ſtande as well with reaſon as to ſee your face in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon glaſſe. But this concluſion and other dyuers of lyke ſorte, are more mete for princes, for ſundry cauſes, than for other men, and ought not to bee taught commonly. Yet to repete it, I thought good for this cauſe, that the worthynes of geometry myght the better be knowen, &amp; partly vnderſtanding geuen, what wonderfull thynges may be wrought by it, and ſo conſequently how pleaſant it is, and how neceſſary alſo.</p>
                  <p>And thus for this tyme I make an end. The reaſon of ſom thynges done in this boke, or omitted in the ſame, you ſhall fynde in the preface before the Theoremes.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not gentle reader, but as my argument is ſtraunge and vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the vulgare tougue, ſo ſhall I of many men be ſtraungly tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of, and as ſtraunglye iudged. Some men will ſaye peraduenture, I mighte haue better imployed my tyme in ſome pleaſaunte hiſtorye, compriſinge matter of chiuaſrye. Some other wolde more haue preiſed my trauaile, if I hadde ſpente the like time in ſome morall matter, other in deciſing ſome controuerſy of religion. And yet ſome men (as I iudg) will not miſlike this kind of mater, but then will they wiſhe that I had vſed a more certaine order in placinge bothe the Propoſitions and Theoremes, and alſo a more exacter proofe of eche of theim bothe, by demonſtrations mathematicall. Some alſo will miſlike my ſhortenes and ſimple plaineſſe, as other of other affections diuerſely ſhall eſpye ſomwhat that they ſhall thinke blame worthy, and ſhal miſse ſomewhat, that thei wold wiſh to haue bene here vſed, ſo that euerie manne ſhall giue his verdicte of me according to his phantaſie, vnto whome ioinctly, I make this my firſte anſwere: that as they ar many and in opinions verie diuers, ſo were it ſcarſe poſsi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe them all with anie one argumente, of what kinde ſo euer it were. And for my ſeconde aunſwere, I ſaye thus. That if annye one argumente mighte pleaſe them all, then ſhoulde thei be thankfull vnto me for this kind of matter. For nother is there anie matter more ſtraunge in the engliſhe tungue, then this whereof neuer booke was written before now, in that tungue, and therefore oughte to delite all them, that deſire to vnderſtand ſtraunge matters, as moſt men commonlie doo. And againe the practiſe is ſo pleaſaunt in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge, and ſo profitable in appliynge, that who ſo euer do the
<pb facs="tcp:16117:49"/>delite in anie of bothe, ought not of right to miſlike this arte. And if any manne ſhall like the arte welle for it ſelfe, but ſhall miſlyke the fourme that I haue vſed in teachyng of it, to hym I ſhall ſaie, Firſte, that I dooe wiſhe with hym that ſome other man, whiche coulde better haue doone it, hadde ſhewed his good will, and vſed his diligence in ſuche ſorte, that I myght haue bene therby occaſioned iuſtely to haue left of my laboure, or after my trauaile to haue ſuppreſſed my bookes. But ſithe no manne hath yet attempted the like, as far as I canne learne, I truſte all ſuche as bee not exerciſed in the ſtudie of Geometrye, ſhall finde greate eaſe and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraunce by this ſimple, plaine, and eaſie forme of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge. And ſhall perceaue the exacte woorkes of Theon, and others that write on Euclide, a greate deale the ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by this blunte delineacion afore hande to them taughte, For I dare preſuppoſe of them, that thing which I haue ſette in my ſelfe, and haue marked in others, that is to ſaye, that it is not eaſie for a man that ſhall trauaile in a ſtraunge arte, to vnderſtand at the beginninge bothe the thing that is taught and alſo the iuſte reaſon whie it is ſo. And by experience of teachinge I haue tried it to bee true, for whenne I haue taughte the propoſition, as it imported in meaninge, and annexed the demonſtration with all, I didde perceaue that it was a greate trouble and a painefull vexacion of mynde to the learner, to comprehend bothe thoſe thinges at ones. And therfore did I proue firſte to make them to vnderſtande the ſence of the propoſitions, and then afterward did they conceaue the demonſtrations muche ſoner, when they hadde the ſentence of the propoſitions firſt ingrafted in their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. This thinge cauſed me in bothe theſe bookes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the demonſtrations, and to vſe onlye a plaine forme of declaration, which might beſt ſerue for the firſte intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. Whiche example hat beene vſed by other learned menne before nowe, for not only Georgius Ioachimus Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, but alſo Boetius that wittye clarke did ſet forth ſome whole books of Euclide, without any demonſtration or any
<pb facs="tcp:16117:49"/>other declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al. But &amp; if I ſhal hereafter perceaue that it maie be a thankefull trauaile to ſette foorth the propoſitions of geometrie with demonſtrations, I will not refuſe to dooe it, and that with ſundry varietees of demonſtrations, bothe pleaſaunt and profitable alſo. And then will I in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner prepare to ſette foorth the other bookes, whiche now are lefte vnprinted, by occaſion not ſo muche of the charges in cuttyng of the figures, as for other iuſte hynderances, whiche I truſte hereafter ſhall bee remedied. In the meane ſeaſon if any man muſe why I haue ſette the Concluſions beefore the Teoremes, ſeynge many of the Theoremes ſeeme to include the cauſe of ſome of the concluſions, and therfore oughte to haue gone before them, as the cauſe goeth before the effecte. Herevnto I ſaie, that although the cauſe doo go beefore the effect in order of nature, yet in order of teachyng the effect muſt be fyrſt declared, and than the cauſe therof ſhewed, for ſo ſhal men beſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d things Firſt to lerne that ſuch thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ar to be wrought, and ſecondarily what thei ar, and what thei do import, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thirdly what is the cauſe thereof. An other cauſe why y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the theoremes be put after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions is this, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wrote theſe firſt cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions (which was .iiiij. yeres paſsed) I thought not then to haue added any theoremes, but next vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to haue taught the order how to haue applied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to work, for drawing of plottes, &amp; ſuch like vſes. But afterward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ſerue for, and the light that thei do geue to all ſortes of practiſe geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall, beſyde other more notable benefites, whiche ſhall be declared more ſpecially in a place conuenient, I thoughte beſte to geue you ſome taſte of theym, and the pleaſaunt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of ſuche geometrical propoſitions, which might ſerue diuerſelye in other bookes for the demonſtrations and proofes of all Geometricall woorkes. And in theim, as well as in the propoſitions, I haue drawen in the Linearie examples many tymes more lynes, than be ſpoken of in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them, whiche is doone to this intent, that yf any manne lyſt to learne the demonſtrations by harte, as ſomme
<pb facs="tcp:16117:50"/>learned men haue iudged beſte to doo) thoſe ſame men ſhould finde the Linearye exaumples to ſerue for this purpoſe, and to wante no thyng needefull to the iuſte proofe, whereby this booke maye bee wel approued to be more complete then many men wolde ſuppoſe it.</p>
                  <p>And thus for this tyme I wyll make an ende without any larger declaration of the commoditees of this arte, or any far<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther anſweryng to that may bee obiected agaynſt my hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of it, wyllyng them that myſlike it, not to medle with it: and vnto thoſe that will not diſdaine the ſtudie of it, I promiſe all ſuche aide as I ſhall be able to ſhewe for their far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procedyng bothe in the ſame, and in all other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees that thereof maie enſue.

For in this figure, the angles of the ſemicircle are thoſe angles which be by A. and D, and be made of the right line A.

Wherfore it muſt nedes folowe, that the angle made in a cantle leſſe then a ſemicircle, muſt nedes be greater then a right angle. So the angle by B, beyng made of the right line A. B, and the righte line B.D, is a iuſte righte angle, becauſe it is made in a ſemicircle. But the angle made by A, which is made of the right line A. B, and of the right line A.
